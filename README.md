# CandyCrushRipoff
Ripoff of Candy Crush game
Creating a ripoff verison of Candy Crush Saga in an attemp to learn C# and Xamarin
at the same time. As of 5/31/16, I'm only planning on creating 10 levels for the game.
My first goal is to create a class that will handle generating candies.
The second goal is to create a class that will act as the grid where the candies will be place.
The third goal is to create a level with the previous two classes.
The fourth goal is to add a background that will be used for the levels.
